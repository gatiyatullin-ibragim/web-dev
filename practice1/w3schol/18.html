The <div> Element

The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.
Example

A <div> element takes up all available width:
Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
Result
Lorem Ipsum
I am a div
dolor sit amet. 
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.












    Example

A <div> element with HTML elements:
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
Result
London

London is the capital city of England.

London has over 9 million inhabitants.















Center align a <div> element

If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.
Example
<style>
div {
  width:300px;
  margin:auto;
}
</style>
Result
London

London is the capital city of England.

London has over 9 million inhabitants.












Multiple <div> elements

You can have many <div> containers on the same page.
Example

  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>

Inline-block

If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.
Example

<style>
div {
  width: 30%;
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>

Flex

The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.
Example

How to use flex to align div elements side by side:
<style>
.mycontainer {
  display: flex;
}
.mycontainer > div {
  width:33%;
}
</style>
Result

London has over 9 million inhabitants.

Rome

Grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.
Example

How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side:
<style>
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
}
</style>
